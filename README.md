The prime contribution of our paper are as follows:

i.	We have worked with three datasets a) CIFAR10 dataset which is trained to classify 10 classes. b) COCO pre-trained dataset and c) our own custom dataset containing images of Bangla number plates.

ii.	We have used the YOLOv4 object detector which gives a more accurate result from most of the object detectors because of more iterations and it is also very fast.

iii.	Python Tesseract OCR has been used with many image processing approaches which is less complex and also faster.
